COMPOSITION
Focus
How the program is designed or built in relation to the music.
Definition
The intentional, developed and / or original arrangement of the repertoire of all types of movements into a meaningful whole according to the principles of proportion, unity, space, pattern and musical structure.
Criteria
Explanation
Multidimensional movements and use of space.
Connections between and within elements.
Choreography reflecting musical phrase and form.
Pattern and ice coverage.
The fluid and controlled movements along or across different planes (high, medium, low, diagonal). The ability to use the space. In pair, ice dance and synchronized skating, all skaters contribute to create an interesting design of movements. Elements must be fully connected with each other with varied and intricate body and skating movements (including changes in hold, movement type, and duration) demonstrating a range of abilities without interruption of the sequence of movements. A unit of movement is a block “element – movements – element”. The element becomes part of the sequence of movements. Form refers to the structure and organization of a musical composition. Phrase is a unit of musical meter that has a complete musical sense of its own. Each Units of movements corresponds to musical phrase and form. Choreographic phrase follows the musical phrase, its beginning, climax and end. The interesting and creative placement of units of movement on the ice. The design of the program and layout covering the entire ice surface. In pair skating, ice dance and synchronized skating, all skaters contribute to create an interesting pattern. For synchronized skating, this includes the ability to stay aligned and maintain symmetry. A coherent entity with all parts appropriately combined, contributing to a sense of completeness. In pair skating, ice dance and synchronized skating, all skaters contribute to making the purpose of the composition clear.
Unity.

PRESENTATION
Focus
How the program is performed in relation to the music
Definition
The demonstration of engagement, commitment and involvement based on an understanding of the music and composition.
Criteria
Explanation
Expressiveness & projection
Variety & contrast of energy and of movements.
3 Musical sensitivity & timing.
Oneness & awareness of space (Pair Skating, Ice Dance, Synchronized Skating).
Through complete personal involvement in the program, the skater(s) express(es) and project(s) a mood, feeling, image, rhythm or style as inspired by the musical selection and by the specific style of the dance. Confident presentation of one’s body and energy to communicate a feeling. Ability to capture the viewer, to arouse emotions. Introduction of a movement or different movements that can serve to intensify meaning and / or to underline an accent or a musical nuance. The force and movement done should vary throughout the program. Ability to move accurately and consistently as required by the characteristics of the music and its elements (melody, rhythm, harmony, tempo, dynamic articulation). Steps and movements follow the musical timing when clearly identifiable or when required by the Regulations or by the specific style of the dance. Finesse of movement(s) to demonstrate an appreciation of musical details, accents and nuances. Appropriate / purposeful translation of music into movements. Performing as a unit. Ability of partners to interact in harmony for expressive purposes with each demonstrating musical sensitivity. An awareness of one’s and each other’s distance and placement without looking. Each skater shares the responsibility of performing the composition with equal ability and competency.


SKATING SKILLS
Focus
The technique of skating and movement
Definition
The ability of the skater(s) to execute the repertoire of steps, turns and skating movements with blade and body control
Criteria
Explanation
Variety of edges, steps, turns, movements and directions.
Clarity of edges, steps, turns, movements and body control.
Balance & glide.
Flow.
Power & speed.
Diversity in the use of edges, steps, turns, body movements, and direction of skating: forwards, backwards, clockwise, counter-clockwise. Ability to execute each edge, step, turn, and body movement precisely and completely. Clarity is the quality and the precision of execution. Edges must be precise from the moment the blade touches the ice. Core control facilitates movement regardless of the plane. Ability of the blade to glide on the ice without friction. Equilibrium over the blade resulting in control of the blade and movement and in the easy and smooth movement of the blade on the ice. Predominance of one foot skating, however can be on 2-feet. Speed is maintained because of balance, control and lack of friction of the blade on the ice. Gliding on long, deep edges is more difficult than short, flat edges. Ability of the whole body to move smoothly, harmoniously and effortlessly, starting from a fluid knee- ankle action. Fluid and effortless transition from one movement to another or from a combination of movements to others. The ability to gain and control speed when stepping from one foot to the other (dynamic stroking). The ability to display acceleration and deceleration, and the execution of the skating repertoire with speed and ease. The ability to execute the skating repertoire of edges, steps, turns, body movements with similarity of technique.
