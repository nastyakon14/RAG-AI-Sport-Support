Serious Error(s) Serious errors are falls and/or mistakes which result in a break in the delivery of the program. This break can be minimal or more pronounced and noticeable. These errors must be reflected in the mark awarded for each program component. The consequence depends on the severity and impact they have on the fluidity and continuity of the program. The following guideline should be used. Category Mark range

Green
When there is only one error and this error minimally impacts the program, the maximum score of 9.50 is possible as noted above.
Orange
Note: For the above to apply, the program as a whole is still deemed to be “Excellent”.
Red
**When there are 2 or more errors and these errors only minimally impact the program, the maximum score of 8.75 is possible. Note: an error by both partners, happening at the same time or not (e.g. Fall by 2) must be considered as 2 errors. Note: this basic principle applies equally when the errors occur within an element and/or outside an element.
