2.3 KEY POINTS AND KEY POINTS FEATURES FOR PATTERN DANCES, SEASON 2025/26
General note: The process used by the Technical Panel to identify Key Points and their correct execution is the same process as for identification of Required Elements and Levels (i.e by majority). Correct or incorrect execution of Key Points is reported on the Judges Details per Skater chart as:
“Yes”: meaning, “all Key Point Features are met and all Edges/Steps are held for the required number of beats”, or “Timing”: meaning, “all Key Points Features are met but one or several Edges/Steps are not held for the required number of beats”, or “No”: meaning, “one or several Key Point Features are not met, whether or not Edges/Steps are held for the correct number of beats. “X”: meaning, “none of the steps within a Key Point were attempted”.
Note:
Cross Roll (Forward/Backward) Requirement/description: Rolling action of the free leg passing continuously the skating foot to the next outside curve. At the same time, the body weight transfers from one outside curve to the new outside curve to create a rolling movement. For Cross Rolls, the free foot passes the skating blade/foot and is placed on the ice in front/back of the skating blade/foot. There is no requirement for the new skating blade to be on an outside edge when it is placed on the ice.
Push/Transition to the next step A change of edge within the last ½ beat of the step is permitted to prepare the push/transition to the next step
Correct holds are the prescribed holds per the Pattern Dance descriptions
BASIC NOVICE For Pattern Dances, there will be no key points described and up to Level 1 will be evaluated. The Judges evaluate the Pattern Dance with the GOE.

**When there are 2 or more errors and these errors only minimally impact the program, the maximum score of 8.75 is possible.
Note: an error by both partners, happening at the same time or not (e.g. Fall by 2) must be considered as 2 errors. Note: this basic principle applies equally when the errors occur within an element and/or outside an element

Serious Error(s)
Serious errors are falls and/or mistakes which result in a break in the delivery of the program. This
break can be minimal or more pronounced and noticeable. These errors must be reflected in the
mark awarded for each program component. The consequence depends on the severity and impact
they have on the fluidity and continuity of the program. The following guideline should be used.: Category
