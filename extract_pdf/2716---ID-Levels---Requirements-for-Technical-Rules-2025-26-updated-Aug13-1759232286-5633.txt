1. CALLING SPECIFICATIONS AND LEVELS OF DIFFICULTY OF REQUIRED ELEMENTS The information is presented in the following order:
▪ Basic principles of calling applicable to all Required Elements; ▪ For each Required Element:
Additional principles of calling; - Additional definitions, specifications to definitions and notes, applicable to additional principles of calling and Levels of Difficulty; - Levels of Difficulty including Characteristics of Levels and Adjustment to Levels.
1.1 BASIC PRINCIPLES OF CALLING APPLICABLE TO ALL REQUIRED ELEMENTS 1. The Technical Panel shall identify what is performed despite what is listed on the Program Content Sheet. 2. The Levels shall be determined according to the Basic and Additional Principles of Calling and Characteristics of Levels fulfilled. They shall not result in giving No Level
to a Required Element as long as the requirements for Basic Level are met.
3. To be given any Level, a Required Element must meet all the requirements for Basic Level. Movements, transitions, and/or choreography that do not fulfill the requirements for elements detailed in the Special Regulations & Technical Rules for Ice Dance 2024, Communication 2700, 2704 and in the below calling specifications of this communication shall not be identified. If a Fall or interruption occurs at the attempt of any Required Element, refer to the Additional Principles of Calling for each Required Element. If a loss of control with additional support (touch down by free leg/foot and/or hand(s)) by one or both partners occurs after a Required Element has commenced and the Element continues without interruption, its Level shall be reduced by 1 Level per error - Refer to the Additional Principles of Calling for these elements: Dance Spin, Dance Lift, Set of Twizzles, One Foot Turns Sequence. This Basic Principle does not apply to Pattern Dance, Pattern Dance Element, Step Sequence (except One Foot Turns Sequence) - Refer to the Additional Principles of Calling for these elements. If a program concludes with the partners starting an element within the required duration of the program (including the additional 10 seconds allowed), the element and its Level shall be identified until the Element stops completely. Elements started after the required duration of the program (including the additional 10 seconds allowed) shall not be identified. If a Dance Spin (FD) or a Dance Lift (RD and FD) is performed in a Step Sequence when not permitted, (including Choreographic Step Sequence/Choreographic Rhythm Sequence), the Step Sequence will be identified with the respective level and the Extra Element will be added and a deduction of -1.0 applied. e.g., MiSt4+ExEl, ChSt1+ExEl. 8. If a Dance Spin is performed in Rhythm Dance, the Dance Spin is not identified. It is not a required element and there is no provision to identify it as an extra element. 9. The Technical Panel shall decide whether any feature to fulfill the Characteristics of Levels is given credit unless this feature is expressly designated as not eligible for Level in the present Communication.
4. 5.
10. If there is an illegal element(s)/movement(s)/pose(s) anywhere in the program, it is identified and receives the appropriate deduction. If there is an illegal element(s)/movement(s)/pose(s) during the execution of any element, the element will receive a Level per the requirements performed or ignored if the minimum requirement for Basic Level is not fulfilled. Feature(s)/difficult pose(s) which are or contain an illegal movement(s)/pose(s) are not considered for level. The same principle and deduction will apply to Choreographic Elements (Confirmed or Ignored + the deduction) and if Confirmed, the element will receive the “!” symbol providing the Choreographic Element meets the minimum requirement to be identified.
11. An error, such as a touchdown, does not constitute an interruption and results in a reduction of the Level by 1 grade per occurrence per partner (unless otherwise stated). 12. For an Entry, Middle or Exit Feature to be considered for Level for an Element, the movement must be continuously performed without pause/hesitation immediately preceding, during and/or after the Element. The Feature and Element must be one unit.
13. Complex is defined as consisting of many different and connected parts. 14. Loss of control with additional support includes stumble/touchdown by free leg/foot and/or hand. 15. More than one touchdown/uncontrolled step with an obvious shift of weight from the skating foot to the other foot will be considered as an interruption. 16. When the skating foot leaves the ice, a step is complete. In addition, each push and/or transfer of weight while on two feet (including scooter push) is considered as a step.
17. The entry and/or exit edge of a Difficult Turn resulting in a temporary deviation in the direction of travel for the step sequence pattern is not considered as a retrogression. However, if a Difficult Turn is executed during a retrogression with both entry and exit edge, it will not be considered for Level by the Technical Panel.
18. The first performed required element(s) according to the well balanced program is identified and given a level, or ignored if the requirements for basic level are not met. 19. Partners skating more than two arms length apart is an error, including in all Required Elements/Choreographic Elements, unless otherwise stated in this Communication.


CHOREOGRAPHIC ELEMENTS
2.1 Definition of Free Dance Choreographic Elements:
Choreographic Assisted Jump/Lifting Movement: at least three assisted jump movements performed continuously, performed anywhere in the program The following requirements apply: - At least three in a row (same or different) performed continuously - Cannot rotate more than 1 rotation in each assisted jump movement by the assisting partner - - No more than 3 steps in between each assisted jump/lifting movement - Either partner may do the assisted jump/lifting movement
Less than 3 seconds off the ice for assisted partner
Choreographic Character Step Sequence: performed anywhere in the program. The ChSt pattern must be different from the chosen pattern for the Style B step sequence. Both partners perform steps around the chosen axis and must proceed from barrier to barrier. The following requirements apply: - Any pattern from the following:
Diagonal, performed from corner to opposite corner • Long Axis, performed from barrier to opposite barrier, primarily along the Long Axis • Short Axis, performed from barrier to opposite barrier, primarily along the Short Axis
Circular, starting from the long barrier at the Short Axis, crossing the long axis on each side of the short axis and completing the circle at the starting barrier. - The requirement from barrier to barrier is fulfilled when at least one of the partners is not more than 2 meters from each barrier. - May be in hold or not touching - Touching the ice with any part (or parts) of the body with controlled movements is permitted. - Touching the barrier either at the start or the finish of the Choreographic Character Step Sequence is permitted. - Retrogression: not permitted. (Performing movements/steps around each partner during a Stop is NOT considered a Retrogression.) Choreographic Hydroblading Movement: performed anywhere in the program, during which both partners perform hydroblading movements The following requirements apply: - A low movement with the upper body almost parallel to the ice. The core of the body must be clearly positioned away from the vertical axis. No other part of the body other than the boot of the free leg is allowed to touch the ice. If any other part of the body, (other than the allowable boot/foot drag of the free leg) touches the ice it may be considered a Chorographic Sliding Movement
Hydroblading movement by both partners at the same time for at least 2 seconds. The start and end of the Choreographic Hydroblading Movement does not have to be performed simultaneously. - May be in hold or not touching - At least one blade by each partner must be on the ice
Choreographic Lift: Dance Lift of minimum 3 seconds and up to 10 seconds and performed after all of the required Dance Lifts.


Choreographic Sliding Movement: performed anywhere in the program, during which both partners perform sliding movements on the ice. The following requirements apply: - Sliding movement by both partners at the same time on any part of the body for at least 2 seconds. The start and end of the Choreographic Sliding Movement does not have
to be performed simultaneously.
May be in hold or not touching, or a combination of both and may also rotate. - Controlled Sliding on two knees or any part of the body will not be considered as a Fall/Illegal Element by the Technical Panel during this element. - Sliding Movement which finishes as a stop on two knees or sitting/lying on the ice is identified as a Choreographic Sliding Movement and a deduction for Fall/Illegal Element is applied.
Performing basic lunge movement by both partners at the same time will NOT be considered as a Choreographic Sliding Movement.
Choreographic Spinning Movement: spinning movement performed anywhere in the program, where both partners perform at least 3 continuous rotations in any hold. The following requirements apply: - - -
on one foot or two feet or one partner being elevated for less than 3 rotations, or a combination of the three, on a common axis which may be moving. in a FD, if the choreographic Spinning movement is performed before the Required Dance Spin and fulfills the basic requirement for Spin Basic Level due to a mistake or for whatever reason, the Choreographic Spinning Movement will be identified as the Required Dance Spin and will receive a Level accordingly. A subsequent Dance Spin performed later in the program may be called a Choreographic Spinning Movement.
Choreographic Twizzling Movement: twizzling movement performed after the required Set of Twizzles, composed of two parts. The following requirements apply: - - -
for both parts: on one foot or two feet or a combination of both for the first part: at least 2 continuous rotations performed simultaneously and both partners must travel (cannot be on the spot) for the second part: at least one of the partners must perform at least 2 continuous rotations with up to 3 steps between the first and second twizzling movement, one or both partners can be on the spot or traveling or a combination of both.
ADDITIONAL PRINCIPLES OF CALLING
2.2. 1. Any Choreographic Element/Movement combined with another Required Element as an ‘Entry’ or ‘Exit’ feature will not be considered by the Technical Panel as a
required Choreographic Element/Movement. It will only be considered by the Technical Panel as an ‘entry’ and/or ‘exit’ feature.
2. Only the first performed required number of different Choreographic Elements shall be identified as the required Choreographic Elements.


2.3. HOW TO CONFIRM CHOREOGRAPHIC ELEMENTS
A Choreographic element is confirmed when the minimum requirement(s) for the element are reached (see chart below)

3. 3.1.
DANCE LIFTS ADDITIONAL PRINCIPLES OF CALLING
Applicable to all Types of Dance Lifts: 1. 2. The first performed Dance Lift(s) shall be identified as the required Dance Lift(s) and given a Level. If a Choreographic Element is required with Choreographic Dance Lift as an option, the first subsequent Dance Lift shall be identified as Choreographic Dance Lift. Subsequent Dance Lift(s) which fulfill the minimum requirement for “Basic” Level shall be identified as a Dance Lift(s) classified as “extra element”, will receive the abbreviation e.g. CuLi+ExEl. It indicates that the element receives No Value, it occupies a box and will receive a -1 deduction. If a Fall or interruption occurs at the attempt of a Lift and it did not fulfill the requirements for Basic Level, the 2nd attempt will be considered for Level.
If the lifted partner is held off the ice for less than 3 seconds, this shall not be identified.
3. 4. Any Dance Lift or part of a Combination Lift of a repeated Type shall be classified as “not according to requirements”, will receive the abbreviation (e.g. CuLi*). It indicates that the element receives No Value, it occupies a box and it will count as a Dance Lift(s). This does not apply to the second part of a Combination Lift composed of two Curve Lifts on two curves forming a serpentine pattern or composed of two Rotational Lifts in different directions.
5. Any Dance Lift of a Type not according to the Required Elements for Rhythm Dance or the Well Balanced Free Dance Program which fulfill the minimum requirement for Basic Level shall be classified as an element “not according to requirements” will receive the abbreviation* (e.g. CuLi* (if the Type of Lift can be identified) or Li* (if the Type of Lift cannot be identified)). It indicates that the element receives No Value, it occupies a box and it will count as a Dance Lift(s). If a program begins with the partners in a Dance Lift before the music starts, the Dance Lift and its Level shall be identified when one of the partners begins to move. If a Fall or interruption occurs after a Dance Lift has been identified (i.e. it has fulfilled Basic Level or higher), the Dance Lift will be given a Level based on what was executed prior to the Fall or interruption. If the couple continues the Lift after the Fall for the purpose of filling time, this will not be considered for Level or as “not according to requirements”. If the Lifting Partner creates a deviation from an established type of Lift, the Technical Panel will reduce the Level by 1. The Technical Panel will consider the first established Type of Lift to determine the Type of Lift. If there is no established Type of Lift, the Technical Panel will consider the first pattern to determine the Type of Lift (Excluding Entry and Exit Features). 8.
6. 7.
9. The lifted partner’s Difficult Pose (options a) to i)) or Change of Pose (option a) or b)) in the RD Short Lift must be different from the same type of Short Lift in the FD or part of the same type of lift in the Combo Lift. The repeated same Difficult Pose (options a) to i)) or same Change of Pose (option a) or b)) performed in the same type of lift will be considered as a simple pose/change of pose for the FD.
10. During any type of Lift, only one Difficult Pose by the Lifted partner and one Difficult pose of the Lifting Partner is considered for level. 11. Any feature attempted or performed is considered as used for level whether required for level or not.
Applicable to Rotational Lifts: 1. A Rotational Lift shall be identified as such if the lifting partner moves through three rotations or more and is held off the ice for 3 seconds or more. 2. If the lifting partner stops rotating at any point, the Level will be reduced by 1 Level per each. 3. If the lifting partner stops travelling, the rotation and features will still be considered for Level. However, a reduction of 1 Level will apply for Pattern Deviation.
Applicable to Combination Lifts: 1. A Combination Lift shall be identified with the first two fully established Types of Short Lifts performed. The Level of each of the two Types of Short Lifts shall be given
separately. If for any reason one of the parts of a Combination Lift cannot be identified, only the other part shall be identified as a Short Lift, and given a Level according to the requirements met, or ignored if the minimum requirements for Basic Level are not met.
3. A One Hand/Arm Lift can only be used as a Combination Lift when both parts are One Hand/Arm Lifts. 4. Two Difficult entry features connected with the 1st Lift considered and accepted for Level for the chosen type of Lift are considered only for the 1st Lift. Two Difficult exit features connected with the 2nd Lift considered and accepted for Level for the chosen type of Lift are considered only for the 2nd Lift. - Only one Difficult entry feature connected with the 1st Lift considered and accepted for Level for the chosen Type of Lift will upgrade the 2nd Lift by one Level. - Only one Difficult exit feature connected with the 2nd Lift considered and accepted for Level for the chosen Type of Lift will upgrade the 1st Lift by one Level.


3.2. ADDITIONAL DEFINITIONS, SPECIFICATIONS TO DEFINITIONS AND NOTES
Difficult Pose for lifted partner (examples): a) Full split: when the legs of the lifted partner are extended with the angle between thighs approximately 180 degrees; b) Full “Biellmann”: body in any orientation (e.g. upright, horizontal etc.) in relation to the vertical line of the body, with the heel of the boot pulled by the hand behind and above
the level of the head;
c) Full doughnut/ring combined with difficult hold/interaction between partners: upper body arched back, with one or both feet almost touching the head in a full circle
(maximum of half a blade length between head and blade);
d) Upside down combined with difficult hold/interaction between partners; e) From a vertical position lifted partner is cantilevered out: lifted partner’s torso is extended away from the lifting partner and the only one additional point of support are the
hands;
f) Balancing in a horizontal position with only one additional point of support; g) Leaning out (forwards or backwards) with the only one additional point of support being the legs; h) Full layback with upper body arched back from the waist with no support from the lifting partner above the thigh; i) Extended out with the majority of body weight in a horizontal line with the only one additional point of support being shoulders and/ or upper back. Notes:
▪ a chosen example of Difficult Pose shall be considered for Level only the first time it is performed ▪ examples b) (full “Biellmann) and c) (full doughnut/ring) shall be considered as the same example of Difficult Pose.
Change of Pose for lifted partner:
A Change of Pose shall be considered for Level if it fulfills the following options a) or b) characteristics: a) Lifting partner changes hold and lifted partner changes hold, body pose and change of basic body axis so that it is a significant sustained change (i.e. a photographer would produce two different photos). Merely changing the position of arm(s) and/or legs, changing the hold or the body pose to the reverse side (mirror) or merely changing the height of the lifted partner’s body do not constitute a Change of Pose.
b) Lifted partner moves continuously through different poses throughout the whole duration of the Short Lift. Note: Changes of Pose shall be considered for Level only the first two times it is performed, whether they are in Short Lifts or in parts of Long Lift.
Difficult Position for lifting partner (Groups of examples): a) One foot; b) Spread Eagle or Ina Bauer on any edge/tracing; c) Any difficult variation of knee bending position, such as Crouch with two knees bent (thighs at least parallel to the ice) or with one knee bent (thigh at least parallel to the
ice) and one leg extended to side or Lunge (thigh at least parallel to the ice);
d) Shoot the Duck (thigh at least parallel to the ice), free leg extended to the front, side or back; e) One Hand/Arm Lift: with no contact other than the lifting partner’s hand/arm and the lifted partner.
Notes:
▪ Example from Group c) (difficult variation of knee bent position) shall not be considered for Level in a Stationary Lift, which is not rotating. ▪ A chosen example of Difficult Position from Groups a) b) c) d) for the lifting partner will be considered for Level the first time it occurs. Any 2nd attempt of a Difficult
Position from Groups a) b) c) d) will not be considered for the Level.
(Exceptions: Combination Lift composed of two Rotational One Hand/Arm Lifts in different directions, where the One Hand/Arm Lift is considered for Level in both directions and Combination Lift composed of two Curve Lifts on two curves forming a serpentine pattern where examples from a) b) c), even on the same edge, can be considered for Levels in both curves).

ice) and one leg extended to side or Lunge (thigh at least parallel to the ice);
d) Shoot the Duck (thigh at least parallel to the ice), free leg extended to the front, side or back.
Note:
▪ To be considered for Level the Difficult Position from Group 3 must be reached before the lifted partner leaves the ice, and, subsequently, must be continuously
sustained or changed without any intermediate position into the Difficult Position considered and given credit for Level
▪ Each subgroup a), b), c), d) considered as one Entry Feature separately; ▪ Each subgroup a), b), c), d) considered for the Level only the first time it is performed. Any 2nd attempt of this Entry Feature from the same subgroup will not be
considered for the Level.
Group 4) Unexpected Entry without any evident preparation
Note:
▪ Considered as one Entry Feature ▪ Considered for the Level only the first time it is performed. The repeated Unexpected Entry will not be considered for the level.

4. DANCE SPINS
4.1. ADDITIONAL PRINCIPLES OF CALLING
1. The first performed Dance Spin is identified as the required Dance Spin and given a Level, or ignored if the requirements for Basic Level are not met. If a Choreographic Element is required with Choreographic Spinning Movement as an option, this element shall be identified as Choreographic Spinning Movement anywhere in the program unless it fulfills the basic definition of a Dance Spin and is performed before the required Dance Spin. Any subsequent Dance Spin and/or Choreographic Spinning Movement performed after the Required Dance Spin and/or Choreographic Spinning Movement shall not be identified.
2. Only features and rotations will be counted from the moment both partners are on one foot. 4.
If a Fall or Interruption occurs at the attempt of a Dance Spin before the requirements for Basic Level have been fulfilled and the Dance Spin is resumed, the Dance Spin shall be identified and given a Level according to what is executed after resumption. If a Fall or Interruption occurs during a Dance Spin, the Dance Spin shall be identified and given a Level according to the requirements met before the Fall or interruption, or ignored if the requirements for Basic Level are not met. If during the Dance Spin any of the following mistakes apply for up to half a rotation and the Dance Spin then continues without interruption, the level will be reduced by 1: • Both partners are not holding due to an error/loss of control; • One partner off the ice due to an error/loss of control. If the mistake lasts for more than half a rotation, this is considered as an interruption and any features/rotations from this point are not considered for the level.
8. A push without a change of foot/change of weight while performing the rotations of the Spin is considered as a touchdown (includes a scooter push). 9. Any transitional movements within a Dance Spin can be performed on two feet for up to half a rotation. More than half a rotation will be considered as a touch down.
10. A sustained stop within the Dance Spin, including during a change of direction before resuming the rotations is an interruption.
4.2. ADDITIONAL DEFINITIONS, SPECIFICATIONS TO DEFINITIONS AND NOTES
DIFFICULT FEATURES:
A. Difficult Variations of Basic Positions (examples):

ADDITIONAL PRINCIPLES OF CALLING
Turn at the same time. The additional Difficult Turns do not have to be performed at the same time. If the first Difficult Turn is not performed at the same time by both partners on One Foot Turns Sequence, its Level shall be reduced by one Level per partner. If a loss of control with additional support occurs during the One Foot Turns Sequence and continues without interruption, its Level shall be reduced by one Level per error for that partner. If a Fall or interruption occurs at the entry edge to the first difficult turn of the One Foot Turns Sequence by either partner, the element is given No Level for the partner who performed the error. The Level of the other partner is evaluated based on what was executed. If a Fall or interruption by one partner occurs during a One Foot Turns Sequence and the element is immediately resumed, the element shall be identified and given a Level for the partner who performed the error according to the requirements met before the fall or interruption, or No Level if the requirements for Basic Level are not met. The Level of the other partner is evaluated based on what was executed. If a Fall or interruption occurs by both partners during any part before the requirements for Basic Level is achieved, the element is ignored. If partners touch in One Foot Turns Sequence the Level shall be reduced by 1 Level per each partner.
6. 7. 8. Hops/jumps landing on the same foot during the One Foot Turns Sequence are permitted.
5.2.
ADDITIONAL DEFINITIONS, SPECIFICATIONS TO DEFINITIONS AND NOTES
Types of One Foot Turns Sequence Difficult Turns: Bracket, Rocker, Counter, Twizzle (Twizzle with one rotation – “Single Twizzle” for Level 1 and 2 or Twizzle with two rotations – “Double Twizzle” for Levels 1 – 4), skated on distinct and recognizable edges and in accordance with the description of Twizzle in Rule 704. Note: An error in any part of a turn will result in the turn not being considered for the Level. This also applies to an error in any part of a Twizzle or “Double Twizzle”, the entire Twizzle is not considered towards the Level. As an example – If the couple includes a “Double Twizzle” as a Difficult Turn and there is a mistake in the execution within any part of the Turn, it is not considered even as a “Single Twizzle”.
CHARACTERISTICS OF LEVELS OF ONE FOOT TURNS SEQUENCE (evaluated as one unit with a separate Level for each partner):
Only the first attempt of a Difficult Turn is considered for Level. • For Level 3 and 4, Twizzle must be done with at least two rotations – “Double Twizzle”

2 different Types of One Foot Turns correctly executed
3 different Types of One Foot Turns correctly executed
ALL 4 different Types of One Foot Turns correctly executed
AND The entire sequence is 100% clean


SETS OF TWIZZLES
6.1. ADDITIONAL PRINCIPLES OF CALLING
1. A Set of Twizzles is evaluated as one unit with a Level given for each partner. 2. The first performed Set of Twizzles shall be identified as the required Set of Twizzles. 3.
If a loss of control with additional support by one or both partners occurs within a Set of Twizzles, the following will apply: ▪ Any loss of control resulting in an error of up to one uncontrolled step is a stumble/touchdown - reduce one level ▪ More than one uncontrolled step is an interruption and any features/rotations from this point are not considered for the level. If a Fall or interruption occurs during the Set of Twizzles and fulfils the requirement for Basic Level, the Set of Twizzles shall be identified and given a level according to the requirements met before the Fall or interruption. If a Fall or interruption occurs by one partner during any part of the first Twizzle, the element is given No Level for the partner who performed the error. The Level of the other partner is evaluated based on what was executed. If a Fall or interruption occurs by both partners during any part before the requirements for Basic Level is achieved, the element is ignored.
6. 7. If any part of first two Twizzles becomes a Pirouette or checked Three Turns, its Level shall be reduced:
▪ By one Level if one of the two Twizzles become Pirouettes or checked Three Turns (considered separately for each partner) ▪ By two Levels if both Twizzles become Pirouettes or checked Three Turns (considered separately for each partner).
8. Entry edge to either Twizzle cannot be from a stand-still, otherwise the Level will be reduced by one Level per stop (considered separately for each partner). 9. 10. If there is more than the maximum or less than the minimum permitted number of steps between the required Set of Twizzles, the Level shall be reduced by 1 Level (considered separately for each partner).
11. If partners touch at any point during the Set of Twizzles when not permitted, the Level shall be reduced by 1 Level per each partner.
6.2. Additional Features (Groups of examples)
ADDITIONAL DEFINITIONS, SPECIFICATIONS TO DEFINITIONS AND NOTES
Group A (upper body and hands including wrists)
▪ Elbow(s) at least at level with or higher than the level of the shoulders. Elbow(s) could be above the head, same level as the head, or lower than the head. Hand(s)
not touching any part of the arms; ▪ Significant continuous motion of arm(s); ▪ Hands touching behind back and extended away from the body; ▪ Hands touching in front, extended away from the body, with arms straight;
Group B (skating leg and free leg):
▪ Coupé in front, side or behind with free foot in contact with the skating leg in at least 45 degrees open hip position; ▪ Holding the blade or boot of the free foot ▪ Free foot crossed behind the skating foot and close to the ice ▪ Free leg extended and/or bent with at least 45 degrees from the inner thigh to the vertical axis, with no less than 90 degrees between the shin and thigh ▪ Sit position (at least 120) degrees between the thigh and shin of the skating leg) ▪ Changing the level of the skating leg (knee) with a continuous wave (up/down) motion.


Group C (pattern, entry, exit):
▪ Third twizzle of at least 3 rotations, performed correctly, started with different entry edge from the first two Twizzles, and preceded by a maximum of one step for Set of
Sequential Twizzles and for Set of Synchronized Twizzles
▪ Entry to the first or second Twizzle from a Dance Jump (the entry edge for the Twizzle will be determined by the landing edge of the Dance Jump) ▪ Two Twizzles performed on one foot without change of foot, with no limit on turns or movements performed on one foot between required Twizzles in Rhythm Dance
and between the second and third twizzle in Rhythm Dance and Free Dance
▪ Set of Twizzles immediately performed directly after entry movements/steps which are at least one of the following: creative, difficult, complex, unexpected.
(May be different per partner.)
▪ Core of body is shifted off vertical axis.
Notes for Additional Features:
A chosen Additional Feature from Groups A and B shall be considered for a Level if it is fully achieved and established: ▪ Within the first half rotation of the Twizzle, and ▪
held until the number of rotations needed for that Level is fully completed (2 rotations for Level 2, 3 rotations for Level 3, 4 rotations for Level 4).
There is no limit on turns or movements performed on one foot on the change of foot or the steps between required Twizzles. Any number of connecting turns after the Twizzle rotations considered for level, including additional single Twizzle(s), are permitted.
The same chosen Additional Feature shall be considered for Level for each partner when it is executed simultaneously by both partners. Any errors are evaluated per
partner. If there is more than one step performed between the 2nd and 3rd Twizzle in a Set of Twizzles, the 3rd Twizzle is no longer considered for Level as a Group C feature. In a Set of Twizzles to achieve the “C” Feature of ‘Two twizzles performed on one foot without change of foot, with no limits on turns or movements, performed on one foot between Twizzles.
▪ The requirement for this feature to be considered is that there are three completed rotations during the Twizzle immediately following this "C" feature. ▪ This same requirement applies if this “C” feature is performed between the 1st and 2nd Twizzles as well as between the 2nd and the 3rd Twizzles. ▪
If, in addition, the 3rd twizzle is performed with at least three rotations AND is executed correctly, then the Technical Panel should consider this as a “C” feature for Level.
The “C” feature(s) attempted in the RD cannot be repeated in the FD for Level and will be ignored by the Technical Panel. This applies even if the features were not given credit for Level in the RD.

STEP SEQUENCES (including PATTERN DANCE TYPE STEP SEQUENCE)
7.1. 1. The first performed Step Sequence of a required Group shall be identified as the required Step Sequence of that Group and given a Level, or ignored if the requirements for Basic Level are not met. Subsequent Step Sequences of that Group and Step Sequences of a Group not according to the Required Elements for Rhythm Dance or the Well Balanced Free Dance Program shall not be identified. In case there is an incorrect element performed as “not according to the requirements”(e.g. Circular Step Sequence instead of e.g. a required MiSt/DiSt) the element will be called, it will fill a box and will receive NO value but will NOT receive a deduction. E.g. CiSt* If a Spin(s) and/or Lift(s) occurs within a Step Sequence (including ChSt) when not permitted, such Spin(s) and/or Lifts will be identified as Extra Element(s) ExEl and receive a deduction, e.g. ChSt1+ExEl. If a Fall or interruption occurs at the attempt to or during a Step Sequence and the element is immediately resumed, the element shall be identified and given a Level according to the requirements met before and after the Fall or interruption, or ignored if the requirements for Basic Level are not met.
ADDITIONAL PRINCIPLES OF CALLING
4. The percentage of steps for a Step Sequence is evaluated on the overall pattern completed per the prescribed shape, i.e. straight line, circle/s-shape, diagonal, etc. 5. A Step Sequence (Style B) is evaluated as one unit by adding the Base Values of the Woman Step Sequence Level and the Man Step Sequence Level and then applying the GOE.
6. A Pattern Dance Type Step Sequence (PSt) (Style D) is evaluated as one unit with a combined Level for both partners. 7.
In Pattern Dance Type Step Sequence (PSt) (Style D), if partners do not remain in hold/contact/touch at all times, even during changes of Hold and allowed stops (except when performing Twizzles as connecting Choreography), the Level shall be reduced by one Level per element. This provision does not apply to loss of contact due to a Fall.
8. Pattern Dance Type Step Sequence (PSt) (Style D) – Two different difficult turns per partner must be performed from the following: Back Entry Rocker, Counter, Back Entry Bracket, Forward Outside Mohawk. Only the first two attempted Different Difficult Turns per partner selected from those above are considered for level. Additional attempts of the same Difficult Turn are ignored. Two of the Different Difficult Turns from those above may be performed at the same time. If the other two Different Difficult Turns are performed at the same time by both Partners, these turns are not considered for level for either partner.
9. A Hold to be considered for the Level must be established.
7.2.

8. 8.1. Key Point and Key Point Features: a Key Point is correctly executed when all its related Key Point Features are met and all its Edges/Steps are held for the required number of beats. Key Points and Key Point Features are technical requirements valid for one season and are published in the corresponding ISU Communication. A change of edge within the last ½ beat of a step is permitted to prepare the push/transition to the next step (unless otherwise prescribed) 8.2. LEVELS OF DIFFICULTY

8.4. ADDITIONAL PRINCIPLES OF CALLING 1. The process used by the Technical Panel to identify Key Points and their correct execution is the same process as for identification of Required
Elements and Levels (i.e by majority). Correct or incorrect execution of Key Points is reported on the Judges Details per Skater chart as: - - - -
“Yes”: meaning, “all Key Point Features are met and all Edges/Steps are held for the required number of beats”, or “Timing”: meaning, “all Key Points Features are met but one or several Edges/Steps are not held for the required number of beats”, or “No”: meaning, “one or several Key Point Features are not met, whether or not Edges/Steps are held for the correct number of beats. “X”: meaning, “a Key Point was not attempted”.
2. Evaluating the percentage of steps for Pattern Dances is based on the total number of steps completed. 3.
If a Fall or interruption occurs at the attempt or during a Pattern Dance Element and the element is resumed, the element shall be identified and given a Level according to the requirements met before and after the Fall or interruption, or ignored if the requirements for Basic Level are not met. If the Pattern Dance Element is interrupted one (1) measure or less (including missing step(s)) (4 or 6 beats based on the PDE) – the key points are called as identified and the level will be reduced by 1. It is reported on the Judges Details per Skater chart as: “<” to indicate an interruption of one (1) measure or less. If the Pattern Dance Element is interrupted more than one (1) measure (including missing step(s)) (4 or 6 beats based on the PDE) but 75% of the steps are completed by both partners, the key points are called as identified and the level will be reduced by 2. It is reported on the Judges Details per Skater chart as: “<<” to indicate an interruption of more than one measure.
6. For Pattern Dance Elements, an interruption may be but is not limited to Fall(s), missing step(s), touchdown(s), etc.
