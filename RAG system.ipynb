A Data Operator assists them for recording purposes. An instantaneous slow-motion video replay system operated by a Replay Operator supports the Technical Panel in the identification of the performed elements.The Technical Specialists identify and call the performed elements and the specific Levels of Difficulty of certain performed elements (e.g. spins, footwork). They identify illegal or additional elements and falls.The Technical Controller authorizes and/or corrects all calls, supervises the Data Operator and can propose corrections, if necessary.In case of disagreement, the majority among the three Officials prevails.Judges Under the ISU Judging System the Judges focus entirely on evaluating the quality of each element performed (Technical Score) and the quality of the performance (Presentation Score)Their scores will be based on specific quality criteria for each element and will provide a comprehensive assessment of each skater’s skills and performance, without comparing each skater in relation to all others. The Judge enters the scores through a touch screen unit. At ISU Events, Judges may review in real time certain elements of the skaters’ performances by means of an instantaneous Video Replay System.Panel of Judges There will be a panel of a maximum of 9 Judges per segment. The scores of these Judges will form the result. Out of these scores, the highest and lowest score of each element or program component are ignored and the average will be taken from the remainder, generating the trimmed mean (average score). The referee is the official responsible for the event in accordance with official rules and the panel of Judges.Technical Score Every Required Element of the Short Program, Free Skating, Rhythm Dance and Free Dance is assigned a base value. Base values of all recognised elements are published annually by the ISU in the Scale of Value chart.The base value of the elements is depending on the number of rotations for jumps or the assigned level of difficulty for elements such as spins, steps, lifts, twizzles, etc. The values are decided by an expert group which includes experienced skaters and coaches.\\xa0During the performance the Technical Panel identifies the element as well as the level of difficulty. The name of the identified element will be listed instantaneously on the Judge’s screen. The Judges then apply the “Grad of Execution” (GOE) to evaluate the quality of the element on a scale of +5, +4, +3, +2, +1, 0, -1, -2, -3, -4, -5. The Judges can either increase or decrease the value of each performed element.The panel's Grade of Execution (GOE) is determined by calculating the trimmed mean of the numerical values of the Grades of Execution (GOE) awarded by a maximum of nine scoring judges. This average will become the final Grade of Execution (GOE) of an individual element.The panel's score for each element is determined by adding the trimmed mean Grade of Execution (GOE) of this element to its base value.The panel's scores for all the elements are added to the Technical Score (Total Element Score).Program Component Score In addition to the technical score, the Judges will award points on a scale from 0.25 to 10 (in increments of 0.25) for the Program Components to grade the overall presentation of the performance. These Program Components are Skating skills, Transitions, Performance, Composition and Interpretation of the Music (for Men Single Skating, Women Single Skating and Pair Skating) or Interpretation of the Music/Timing (for Ice Dance). Several factors, as detailed below, are to be taken into account when the Judges consider each component.\\xa0The panel's score for each Program Component is reached by calculating the trimmed mean of the scoring Judges results for that Program Component. The panel's scores for each Program Component are then multiplied by a set factor to ensure that the Total Element Score and Program Component Score are approximately balanced, and the results are rounded to two decimal places.For Pair Skating and Ice Dance there must be equal demonstration of the criteria by both skaters.The Skater's/Pair's/Couple’s whole performance is evaluated by three Program Components: Composition, Presentation and Skating Skills. For Pair Skating and Ice Dance there must be equal demonstration of the criteria by both Skaters.Composition:\\xa0the intentional, developed and/or original arrangement of the repertoire of all types of movements into a meaningful whole according to the principles of proportion, unity, space, pattern, and musical structure. In evaluating the Composition, the following must be considered:- Multidimensional movements and use of space;- Connections between and within elements;- Choreography reflecting musical phrase and form;- Pattern and ice coverage;- Unity.Presentation:\\xa0the demonstration of engagement, commitment and involvement based on an understanding of the music and composition. In evaluating the Presentation, the following must be considered:- Expressiveness and projection;- Variety and contrast of energy and of movements;- Musical sensitivity and timing;- Oneness and awareness of space (Pair Skating, Ice Dance).Skating Skills:\\xa0the ability of the Skater to execute the skating repertoire of steps, turns, and skating movements, with blade and body control. In evaluating the Skating Skills, the following must be considered:- Variety of edges, steps, turns, movements and directions;- Clarity of edges, steps, turns, movements and body control;- Balance and glide;- Flow;- Power and speed.- Unison (Pair Skating, Ice Dance).Final Score The Total Segment Score for each participant in each Segment of a competition (Short Program/Rhythm Dance, Free Skating/Free Dance) is calculated by adding the Total Elements Score and the Program Component Scores, subtracting any deductions (for example -1.0 for a fall).In Ice Dance, for events with two Pattern Dances, the Total Score for each dance will be multiplied by a factor of 0.5 in Basic Novice, 0.75 in Intermediate Novice and 1.0 in Advanced Novice.The Total Segment Score of both programs are added and the result constitutes the Final Score in a competition. The participant with the highest total score wins.Availability of Data and Statistics At the end of each segment, a list will be published which includes all relevant scoring data for skaters.Under the ISU Judging System there is far more data available to analyze than before. This data can help the National Federations, athletes and coaches to improve future performances.The media, skating fans and general public can find statistics and detailed data on the ISU Home of Skating website.Officials Accountability A dedicated computer software identifies possible anomalies which are further checked by an appointed Officials Assessment Commission. These anomalies can either be supported or refuted by the Commission as possibilities for a variance in the scoring. Refuted possibilities or repeated errors by a single official could result in a sanction.Personal Bests / World Standings The ISU maintains on-going statistics regarding individual records. This includes information on personal bests, highest scores, seasonal bests etc. The “Seasons Best” is displayed for each skater/couple on the scoreboard in the arena. The most important individual results over the period of the current and two previous seasons are ranked in the World Standings.Minimum Total Technical Scores Skaters/couples participating in the Figure Skating Championships must have reached the Combined Total Elements Scores (SP/RD + FS/FD) during the ongoing season or the immediately preceding season:The Combined Total Elements Score (not including Component Scores) is calculated by adding the Skaters/Couples highest Technical Elements Score in Short Program / Rhythm Dance and the Free Skating / Free Dance and must have been reached in an ISU recognized International Competition (as per Article 39, paragraph 7 of the ISU Constitution and Rule 107, paragraphs 1 to 10 of the ISU General Regulations) during the ongoing or preceding season (See ISU Special Regulations Single & Pair Skating Ice Dance, Rule 378, paragraph 4). The Skaters/Couples highest Technical Elements Score in Short Program / Rhythm Dance and the Free Skating / Free Dance to calculate the Combined Technical Elements Score may be reached at different competitions.For full and up to date information on the current Minimum Total Technical Scores please refer to the ISU Media Guide for Figure Skating Required Elements For full and up to date information on the current required Elements please refer to the ISU Media Guide for Figure Skating.Technical Panel Handbook28 Jul 2025 Single Skating 2025/26 Technical Panel Handbook28 Jul 2025 Pair Skating 2025/26 Round Table discussion guidelines21 Jul 2025 Handbook for Referees & Judges - Single and Pair Skating 2025/2621 Jul 2025 Thinking words for Program Components scale05 Jun 2025 Program Components Chart05 Aug 2024 Single & Pairs, Ice Dance and Synchronized Skating Composition, Presentation and Skating Skills Charts29 Jul 2024 Deductions: Who is responsible?29 Jul 2024 Single & Pair Skating Q&As SP Q&A 1 - 2025-26 Pair Jump01 Oct 2025 Clarification: Pair Skating Jump Elements SP Q&A 2 - 2025-26 Spins07 Oct 2025 Clarification: Spins Singles and Pairs Composition, Presentation and Skating Skills Charts29 Jul 2024 Who is Responsible Chart (Novice)30 Aug 2023 Pattern Dance Chart (Novice)30 Aug 2023 Program Components – Pattern Dances30 Aug 2023 Pattern Dance and Pattern Dance Element Information30 Aug 2023 How to Confirm Choreographic Elements30 Aug 2023 Key Points and Key Points Features for Junior Pattern Dance Elements – Adjustments from Communication 2560 Rocker Foxtrot30 Aug 2023 Grade of Execution of Required Elements (including Choreographic Elements)30 Aug 2023 Explanation of Symbols on the Judges Details per Skater (Novice)30 Aug 2023 Grade of Execution of Pattern Dance Elements & Pattern Dances30 Aug 2023 Deduction Chart (Rhythm Dance and Free Dance) – Who is Responsible (Junior and Senior)30 Aug 2023 Explanation of Symbols on the Judges Details per Skater (Junior And Senior)30 Aug 2023 Related Communications Additional Q&As Descriptions & Diagrams Description & Diagrams (Novices)Music Rhythms Additions ISU Communication 271630 Sep 2025 Ice Dance Requirements for Technical Rules season 2025/26 ISU Communication 262530 Sep 2025 ICE DANCE GUIDELINES FOR INTERNATIONAL NOVICE COMPETITIONS 2025/26 ISU Communication 270530 Sep 2025 Ice Dance Scale of Values valid as of July 1, 2025 ISU Communication 270430 Sep 2025 Ice Dance Requirements for Technical Rules with ongoing validity, effective July 1st, 2025 Q&A 1 2025-26 Pair Jump30 Sep 2025 Clarification Pair Skating Jump Elements Argentine Tango - Chart and description24 Aug 2022 Argetine Tango - Key Points and Timing Chart24 Jul 2022 Midnight Blues description chart09 Aug 2021 Blues diagram09 Aug 2021 Blues description chart09 Aug 2021 Midnight Blues diagram09 Aug 2021 Tea-Time Foxtrot (Diagram)24 Jul 2019 Finnstep (Diagram)24 Jul 2019 Tango Canasta26 Aug 2019 Quickstep26 Sep 2019 Foxtrot26 Aug 2019 European Waltz (Description & Chart)30 Jul 2019 Starlight Waltz (Description & Chart)30 Jul 2019 European Waltz (Diagram)30 Jul 2019 Starlight Waltz (Diagram Lady)30 Jul 2019 Starlight Waltz (Diagram Man)30 Jul 2019 Willow Waltz06 May 2018 Basic Novice (Updated)Fourteen Step23 Apr 2018 Intermediate Novice Fourteen Step (diagram)23 Apr 2018 Intermediate Novice Tango23 Apr 2018 Intermediate Novice Tango (diagram)23 Apr 2018 Intermediate Novice Tango Fiesta22 Apr 2018 Basic Novice Dance Styles and Rhythm Examples for Junior Rhythm Dance Season 2022-2302 Sep 2022 Senior Rhythms Dance Styles Descriptions24 Aug 2022 Junior Rhythms Dance Styles Descriptions24 Aug 2022 Hip Hop17 Jul 2014 Spanish Dances Rhythms03 Apr 2014document Declaration Form28 Jul 2025 Guideline Judges Meeting - Single & Pair Skating28 Jul 2025 Structure of Judges Round Table Discussion25 Jul 2025 Guidelines Guideline Judges Meeting - Ice Dance16 Jul 2024 Judges Feedback on Referee & Technical Controller24 Jul 2019 Attachment to the Referee's report for International Competitions20 Oct 2018 Confirmation of the Organizing Committee / Organizing Members31 Jul 2013for International Competitions Seminars Participation Form01 Jul 2025 Application form to host an ISU Judge's Seminar31 Jul 2013\""
